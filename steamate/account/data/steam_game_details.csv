It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <strong>AI Storyteller</strong>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br><br><strong>Your colonists are not professional settlers</strong> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br><br><strong>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.</strong> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.<br><br><strong>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</strong> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.<br><br><strong>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</strong> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>Travel across the planet.</strong> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.<br><br><strong>You can tame and train animals.</strong> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br><br><strong>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</strong> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.<br><br><strong>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</strong> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.<br><br>And there's much more than that!

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Expectations:</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1144200/extras/sp_coop.png?t=1733935197"" /></p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Take Command:</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss.

Thousands of ships and stations trade, mine and produce, all realistically simulated. In this universe, you can grow from being the lone pilot of a fighter ship, to managing a vast empire, commanding your fleets and designing colossal space stations. Transition seamlessly from first-person action, boarding ships and visiting their bridges, to an expansive strategy and management simulation. Choose your own path at your own pace.

No matter how you start, you are always <strong>free to develop in any other direction</strong>. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to <strong>you</strong> to decide.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Fly every ship</h2>X4 allows you to <strong>fly all ships personally</strong>. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a <strong>seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships</strong>. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392160/extras/x4-steam2023-building.gif?t=1740085754"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Build space stations and upgrade your ships</h2>Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to <strong>establish their own economy</strong> and <strong>start influencing the universe on a larger scale</strong>. In X4, it is now possible to be completely <strong>free and creative</strong>. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The <strong>powerful new map system</strong> allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Experience the most dynamic X universe ever</h2>X4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to <strong>freely build and expand their empires</strong>; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can <strong>influence the course of the entire universe</strong>.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392160/extras/x4-steam2023-map.gif?t=1740085754"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Manage your empire with a powerful map</h2>Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Dive into the most detailed X economy ever</h2>One of the key selling points of X games has always been the<strong> realistic, simulated economy</strong>. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game,<strong> all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources</strong>. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Research and teleport</h2>The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: <strong>Teleportation</strong>. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders."

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1736457615"" /><br><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

A planned economy puts you in control of everything from mining resources to manufacturing goods and providing services – use this power to make decisions that impact your citizens’ day-to-day lives and their ultimate loyalty to the nation. Whether it’s construction, transportation, trade, healthcare, education, entertainment, tourism, or any of the countless other facets of a full-fledged city, it’s up to you to determine availability, accessibility, and quality. Contend with a deep simulation of global supply chains as you seek fertile soils, ore veins, and viable lands upon which to build your nation – let the radio stations sing your praises and the citizens rejoice in their glorious soviet republic.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/784150/extras/headline_01.png?t=1740151334"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/784150/extras/image_02_loop.gif?t=1740151334"" /><br>Multiple complex simulations work together to bring your cities to life in Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic – whether it’s the price of goods in the global market, the proper distribution of electricity and water, or the increased supply of heat during the winter months, everything can be manipulated with the right actions. Adjust your game settings based on your appetite for complexity in particular areas – civil engineers, urban planners, economists, and simulation enthusiasts will all be able to experience the mechanics they love.<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Run your nation with both rubles and dollars as you strike a balance between eastern and western markets, trading with nations from either side of the Iron Curtain to gain access to valuable currency, resources, and technology. Despite following a soviet-styled planned economy, you are a fledgling non-aligned nation – this sets you free to engage in trade with both the Western Bloc and the Soviet Bloc to your benefit. Loyalty to one side is always an option, but flooding one market with your goods might result in diminishing returns, and shunning the other side might see you cut off from useful technological advances.<br></li><li> Familiarize yourself with the intricacies of realistic supply-chain management with over 30 commodities to acquire, manufacture, and transport. Raw materials, processed goods, and waste material all have specific places where they can be stored, with specific vehicles needed for their transportation, and specific structures needed for loading and unloading. Liquids are stored in tanks and moved with the help of pipes and pumps, or loaded onto vehicles with tanks. Mined ores are stored in aggregate storage facilities, and moved with conveyor belts and flatbed trucks and train cars. Processed goods, meanwhile, are shipped around in covered trucks and train cars, and stored in warehouses. Organize forklifts for short distance hauling, build intricate conveyor belt networks to minimize your reliance on vehicles, or use trains to haul goods from one city to another – supply-chain management is an integral part of operating a nation, and you’ll use everything from cargo planes to freight trains to cargo helicopters to make sure everything is operating smoothly.<br></li><li> Every road, bridge, residential building, and factory is built from the ground up with resource costs reflecting the size of the project. Pay market rates for raw materials to execute quick builds with the help of foreign labor, or establish construction offices and provide employment to your population as they head to construction sites to build everything using locally acquired resources. Buildings can require anything from prefab panels, to steel beams, gravel, concrete, and more – produce and supply them locally, or import them to simplify the process.

Ensuring the people remain happy and loyal is essential to your success.<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Follow your citizens from childhood to the end of their lives, providing them with essential goods such as food and clothes (and alcohol) while simultaneously ensuring they have access to opportunities in the form of education and employment. Be wary of those that lack loyalty to the republic – they are prone to a life of crime, and their reduced efficiency can hurt throughput. Oftentimes, they are best left without access to opportunities where they can do more harm than good. Monitor your nation’s overall happiness and loyalty to ensure few are choosing to leave – provide them with better lives, or rely on propaganda to get the most out of your citizens.<br></li><li>Your peoples’ needs can be imported from neighboring countries, or they can be manufactured locally through complex production chains. Massive fields will harvest grains that can be turned into bread and booze at food factories and distilleries. Clothes factories will produce clothes as long as they have fabric, which in turn is produced at fabric factories with the help of crops, chemicals, and water. Manufacture or otherwise acquire all manner of goods, from the aforementioned necessities to the luxuries of radios and TVs, and transport them from factories to warehouses to local stores where your citizens can obtain them to fulfill their needs. <br></li><li>There are many essential services your citizens will want access to as well – electricity, water, and heat are necessary for survival, each with their own supply chains to maintain. Watch for demand to ebb and flow with the seasons, and prepare for harsh winters lest your population suffers a sudden tragic drop. Education is provided through schools and universities, with higher levels of education opening up additional employment opportunities for your people, unlocking access to new technologies and production capabilities in your nation. Entertainment comes from local parks and theaters as well as radio and TV stations, while physical fitness is provided by local pools and sports fields. Ensuring these services are available and within reach through an efficient transit system is essential for a healthy, prosperous populace.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/784150/extras/headline_03.png?t=1740151334"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/784150/extras/image_04_loop.gif?t=1740151334"" /><br>From roads to railways, and from sea to sky, managing the transportation of goods and people is vital to the health of your republic.

Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Assume your role as the captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.

In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.

Gameplay
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion.

Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.

Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!

The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!"

Finally, the Bloodshed Card demands a human sacrifice. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You must find a way to complete these harsh trials – and weather its dire consequences.

One Shadowverse. Japan's #1 strategic card game.<br />
Made by card gamers for card gamers. <br />
<br />
Shadowverse is Japan's #1 strategic card game!<br />
- There are millions of Shadowverse battles every day, and a multitude of ways to play<br />
- Easy to get into, thanks to a singleplayer story mode, free card packs for new players, and bonuses every day <br />
- Battles are finely balanced, with less RNG than other card games, and balance adjustments take place every month<br />
- New card expansions are released every three months, unleashing new deck-building strategies and battle tactics<br />
- We’ve got a great community of 22 million players and counting, with tournaments and esports broadcasts every week and support for streamers <br />
- Featuring beautiful art and animations and fully voiced cards and story<br />
<br />
<br />
- A multitude of ways to play: <br />
With eight different leader classes, Shadowverse gives you unparalleled freedom to create your own deck strategies. Will you play as Urias and unleash your Vengeance when your health is depleted? Or will you select Isabelle, whose spells power up the cards in your hand? Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? It’s entirely up to you. <br />
<br />
- Easy to get into: <br />
Learn the basics by playing through our extensive singleplayer story mode before taking on other players in our multiplayer modes. Be sure to pick up your free card packs after you’ve finished playing through the tutorial – just go to your Crate from the main menu to pick them up. And bonuses and daily missions help you unlock new card packs every day so it won’t be long before you have a deck that is capable of competing with the very best. <br />
<br />
- Finely balanced: <br />
There’s less RNG in Shadowverse than other card games, making it supremely balanced: you’ll need to trust your judgement not your luck if you are to come out on top. And we make balance adjustments every month to make sure that no one card or deck type becomes too dominant.<br />
<br />
- New card expansions released regularly: <br />
New card expansions are added every three months to make sure the meta never gets stale. And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. We’re in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too.<br />
<br />
- Beautiful art:<br />
All of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japan’s finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline. <br />
<br />
- A great community:<br />
And last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck. Millions of card gamers can’t be wrong – why don’t you join them?"

You then have the possibility, to either just play your custom maps on your own server, or to upload them to the Steam-Workshop and share your creations with the whole community.<br>Accordingly, you can also browse through other players map creations to download and play your favorite ones."

为什么会被微软防火墙判断为病毒或其他杀软拦截或者更新失败卡死？<br />
答：个人开发者开发的小游戏，没有公司资质或安全背书。因为游戏有联网操作，所以会被各种安全软件误报为威胁而拦截删除。有时候更新完之后新的exe程序还未提交给杀软厂商白名单审核，所以也会被识别为危险软件。更新失败卡死也是同样的原因，杀软识别为病毒自动删除了程序，所以不管怎么更新都会一直失败。<br />
<br />
如何解决：百度一下如何彻底关闭win10 defener。用其他杀毒软件的话将游戏加入白名单也行（每次更新客户端都要加，因为exe程序更新了）<br />
<br />
这是一款文字挂机类修仙小游戏，主打的就是上班摸鱼挂机修仙。<br />
游戏介绍：<br />
游戏主打摸鱼时能够聊天吹牛，并且聊天环境会被维护的很轻松休闲（禁止一切涉黄、低俗之类的言论，违者禁言或封号）。<br />
目前游戏经过重新设计优化（写设计文档写了3个月，200多页），游戏本身已经做到了很大程度的平衡，玩家直接没有最强，基本都是互相克制，具体可以通过游玩体验。<br />
游戏目前已开发的共有11个功能（还有几个功能慢慢开发）<br />
介绍一下目前已有功能：<br />
人物：<br />
人物界面能够看到自己的所有属性，大部分内容都是能够看懂的，有几个需要单独介绍下。<br />
首先修为跟血量挂钩，1修为=1血量。<br />
唯一通行货币就是金币，金币可以在市井里交易购买其他人的物品。<br />
精力和体力也做了改动，可以叠加了，每日签到获取精力时不会清空剩余的数值，而是直接叠加上去，等于就是无限上限！<br />
运势只有有普通，好运，超级好运。运势涉及到历练收益、挖矿采药收益，具体可在游戏时体会。<br />
闪避命中改为了通过装备中的佩饰来获取了，新增了暴击和韧性，暴击意为战斗时几率打出倍率伤害，而韧性是抵消对方对你打出暴击的概率。<br />
五行属性：<br />
金：1金=1物理攻击<br />
火：1火=1道术攻击<br />
木：1木=50血<br />
土：1土=1物理防御<br />
水：1水=1道术防御<br />
装备属性：防具和武器的第二属性，具体可以在字面意思看出来，属于战斗时发挥作用的属性。<br />
背包：<br />
背包功能就跟大部分网游的背包基本一样，只是大幅度优化了体验，在背包物品上左键和右键都可以有对应的弹出框操作，具体可以实际体验（非常方便）。同时背包里放入了穿戴装备功能，能够看到已穿戴的装备。本游戏中装备是主要玩法之一。<br />
历练：<br />
历练是主要玩法中的另一个重要点，通过历练不同的地图能够获取不同的属性点，每个属性点加的属性都不一样，具体的可以根据自己喜欢的属性去历练。<br />
洞府：<br />
洞府包含了道侣、单双修、打坐挖矿采药功能。<br />
单修：每12分钟恢复1精力<br />
双修：每10分钟恢复1精力<br />
单修双修成功时可以获得2-5金币或修为<br />
单双修成功时有几率获得1灵玉，福袋<br />
双修时成功了可以获得道侣好感度，双修失败将会降低好感度，最低为0<br />
单双修时不可以历练<br />
单双修、打坐无论是失败还是成功都有几率触发机遇事件（2%概率）<br />
打坐可以恢复体力，每15分钟可以恢复1体力。打坐时不可以挖矿，采药。<br />
挖矿可以获得灵石，采药可以获得灵草，灵石可以用来强化，灵草后面可以用来炼丹。<br />
BOSS:<br />
可以获得金币和修为，几率获得对应地图所属装备，具体爆率可以查看各BOSS爆率。每日报名时间为0-15点，15-0点为获取结果时间。<br />
市井：<br />
就是其他网游的摆摊功能，可以自由交易，任何物品都可以交易！每日领取的物品也可以交易！没有国产游戏的呕心绑定系统！<br />
排行榜：<br />
可以玩到各个属性的排名，每2小时自动更新一次，大部分榜单只能看到你所属大境界的排名，例如你是合体境，那么你只能看到合体境及以下的前50名排名。另外需要用户主动去点击同步数据，你的各属性数据才会同步进排行榜进行排名的。<br />
奇遇：<br />
历练、单双修、打坐、采药挖矿时无论失败还是成功都有几率遇到奇遇，遇到的奇遇有效期为2个小时，2个小时之后想要恢复奇遇就得使用奇遇丹，目前每日签到可以获取奇遇丹，后面通过炼丹可以获得奇遇丹。奇遇顾名思义可以获得一些东西也可能失去一些东西，具体有哪些东西就通过游玩来体验吧！<br />
设置：<br />
目前设置里有设置最小化时是托盘化还是放置任务栏，以及在设置里戴上你拥有的称号（称号需要在背包里使用后才能显示在设置里面，使用后就变成你自己的物品了不可以交易，在背包里的称号物品是可以交易的！）<br />
反馈：<br />
有任何问题或BUG可以通过反馈快速提交，作者看到后会进行回复，一些重大BUG会给与称号的奖励！"

<br />
If you've played RPG's before, Idle Clans will make you feel right at home. With almost 20 skills to train and a deep combat system to dive into, you'll discover a ton of fun and interesting ways to progress your account. Even if you're not a role-playing veteran though, we've put a lot of effort into making the game as easily accessible as we could! Skills are as easy to level up in as clicking the objective you want to complete and... that's it! Your character will take care of the rest - even when you go offline!<br />
<br />
Smith your armour, craft your weapons, enchant your jewellery to provide different boosts, brew a large variety of potions and prepare for combat! Enemies range all the way from measly turkeys to the bosses behind the locked doors of The Valley of Gods. Or if fighting things isn't your cup of tea, you could sell your hard-earned items to other players in your very own shop.<br />
<br />
Another large part of the game, as you might guess from the name, is clans! Create your own or join an established clan to enjoy a variety of benefits on top of the social experience. Clans have their own levels and a fraction of the experience every player gains is sent to the clan. With high enough levels and reputation, leaders of the clan can purchase upgrades that everyone in the clan benefit from. On top of that, there's shared housing and a shared vault that clan members can enjoy. <br />
<br />
In game you'll also find leaderboards where you can compete both individually and with your clan. <br />

That's just a fraction of the available content though - come give Idle Clans a closer look! It's free!"

It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br><br><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1738188317"" /><br>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy.

As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long.

The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul."

<br />
VBridger allows for the augmentation of tracking data, allowing users to combine, mix, and modify live data for use with VTuber Avatars. It comes with several base settings and samples for different types of models. If you have a standard live2D model, you can use our VTS Compatible settings to enhance the tracking quality. If you have a model rigged for ARKit using our parameter guide, you will be able to use our ARKit settings for advanced expression control. If you have an ARKit compatible VRM model, you can use VMC to send tracking data, allowing you to use input curves to tune and calibrate the tracking to better fit your face. <br />
<br />
With the VBridger - Editor DLC, riggers can unlock the full potential of VBridger and their rigs by gaining the ability to create new outputs and custom controls for their models. Use your face to toggle VRM exressions via VMC, or create logic based expressions to add flutter to your live2D wings- the possibilities are endless.<br />
<br />
Current available input sources:<br />
    •Tracking data from the IPhone ARKit FACS based face tracking system from the following apps<br />
            •ifacialmocap (iPhone)<br />

Current available output software:<br />
    •Vtube Studio via the Vtube Studio API allowing for the control of live2D models.<br />
    •Virtual Motion Capture (VMC) Protocol allowing for any VMC compatible app to recieve face data from VBridger. As long as an output shares the name of a blendshapeclip on your VRM, you can control it with VBridger.<br />
          VMC will only work on the facial tracking of the model, it cannot send head rotation, eye rotation, or control the body at the moment.<br />

1593350,Increlution,game,"13 Oct, 2021","₩ 4,500",Gniller,Gniller,"Single-player, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing","Indie, Early Access",1093,0,0,"Survive the ever increasing pressure of time for as long as you can!<br><br>Increlution is a minimalistic incremental game about time management that takes inspiration from roguelite games. It's up to you to survive as long as you can with the tools that you unlock throughout life, such as food or constructions. As time goes on, your health will decline increasingly faster until you'll eventually die. However, death merely marks a new beginning. With every generation, your chances at survival will increase, because progress in previous lives increases your instincts.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Managing time</h2>Throughout life, you'll have access to various jobs, constructions and explorations. Using the step-by-step queue system, you can plan exactly what you want to happen and the game will automatically follow your orders. When your queue is empty, the game pauses automatically, so you don't lose any of your precious time! This is a game about planning and strategizing, not a game about micro-management or clicking. However, if you prefer to play more real-time, you can prioritize anything over your queue at any time.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Skills</h2>Every action uses one of many skills, such as Farming of Woodcutting. Every skill has two leveling types, Generation levels and Instinct levels. Generation levels increase more rapidly and provide a bigger benefit throughout life. Instinct levels increase at a slower pace, but persist through death, creating a permanent improvement for every following life. The combined effect of these levels directly affects how quickly you can perform actions that use these skills, allowing you to spend more of your time on other actions to increase your chances to survive!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Story based progression</h2>You progress through the game with a story. Exploring the world allows you to discover new tools to improve your chances at survival. Unlike most incremental games, having a story also means the game includes no procedural content, and you're actually able to complete the game. That story features approximately 220 hours of unpaused content in the 11 chapters that are currently available in Early Access. During Early Access, that story will be expanded significantly, until the game contains between 20 and 25 chapters. When the story is finished entirely, the currently available new game plus feature will be further expanded to offer an option to continue playing after completing the game.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Meta progression</h2>Every generation will have better chances at survival than the last. The longer you survive, the more those chances will increase! This cycle of life and death plays a fundamental part in the overall progression through the game. Death is inevitable, but never pointless!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Understandable numbers, yet mathematically fluent</h2>All progression within the game is carefully balanced to provide a consistent feeling of improvement, while numbers are tuned to remain understandable. Most bonuses compound, which keeps your progression consistent and meaningful, without requiring overly complicated mechanics. So you can focus on what matters most, survival!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Play the first chapter for free with the demo</h2>Like many things in life, you can only truly judge whether something fits your liking by trying it first hand. For that reason, Increlution features a free demo so you don't have to take anyone's word for it! Try it yourself, and only join Early Access if you're completely convinced that it'll be worth your while! Progress made in the demo will automatically be synchronized to the full version through Steam Cloud, so you won’t lose any of your progress! The Demo features the first chapter and contains roughly 7 hours of unpaused content.<br><br><br>Interested? Try the demo right now by downloading it at the top of this page!"

A place of mystery and wonder, these islands are home to pirates, vagrants, and all manner of strange folk – but the forces of the Inquisition have set their sights on these isles you call home, and will stop at nothing to eradicate your people as they seek a powerful pirate artifact buried in the region.

With eight undead crew members waiting to be revived, you can choose who to recruit to your cause, and when – there are no wrong choices, but your crew’s composition will determine how you traverse the islands, your unique experience through the narrative campaign, and what abilities you have at your disposal at any given time.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""> Each of your eight shipmates is an individual armed with their own unique supernatural powers and mildly unhinged personalities – use these to your advantage in clever and creative ways to overcome obstacles and enemies. Will you bring Gaëlle and her magical cannon to launch friends over walls and chasms, or will you rely on Mr. Mercury’s ability to bypass obstacles from below? Or perhaps von Presswald can simply possess an enemy guard, use him to unlock the gates, and stand idly by as the rest of your motley crew walks in? Use these and other abilities individually and in tandem, timing their executions to orchestrate intricate maneuvers and attacks against overwhelming odds.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""> Mix and match your crew's abilities to find your preferred  playstyle among the countless synergies that you can deploy against the Inquisition. Each person’s skills are tailored to specific archetypes built around manipulating movement, operating behind enemy lines, hiding the bodies of dispatched enemies, or being particularly capable killers.

Or will you seek to make haste, arriving at and leaving from more heavily guarded parts of the island to be closer to your objective from start to finish? </p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""> The various types of enemies have different strengths and weaknesses, each warranting varied strategies – what may easily distract or defeat one foe may have no effect on another adversary.

Suledie’s magic can create cover anywhere, allowing you to get even closer for the kill, or sneak past any watchful eyes undetected. Particularly attentive guards watching a path from above?

This may allow you to upgrade your crew’s abilities to more powerful versions that open up new paths. Or perhaps an entirely different, not-yet-unlocked crew member would be useful instead?  </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The Inquisition must be stopped at all costs – assemble your crew, learn their powers, and take the fight to the enemy, one island at a time.

《三国群英传Ⅱ》是由奥汀科技运营研发的一款即时战略游戏。于1999年发行，为《三国群英传》系列游戏作品的第二部。游戏开创性地在此类游戏中引入了即时战略的时间概念、独特的内政和作战模式、动听的CD音轨以及华丽的背景地图。<br />
<br />
游戏特色：<br />
1.	内政经营模式，享受运筹帷幄的快乐<br />
每年进入一月时就会进入内政经营模式，此时，玩家所占领的城市都会有税收进帐。人口数的提高将使此城能有更多的税收并提高预备兵上限。<br />
<br />
2.	自治施行指令，简化城市探索的繁琐<br />
通过“搜索”指令可以找到武将，更多的是找到诸如武器、马匹、兵符和特殊物品。搜索到的物品和战斗时缴获的战利品可以通过“使用物品”分配给所需武将，用于提高武将的能力或忠诚度。<br />
在城市较多时，也可以用“自治施行”这个指令使某一城市自动使用搜索和开发。但在此模式下找到的物品将不会显示，除非能够找到人才。<br />
<br />
3.	解锁地图战斗，纵享驰骋沙场的畅快<br />
大地图上会显示许多飘扬着不同颜色旗帜的城市及城市间的道路以及在路线上移动的兵团部队。在大地图模式下，两个所属不同国家的兵团相遇，或一方的兵团进入另一方的城市时，就会进入战斗模式。<br />
<br />
4.	战场交战胜利，决定俘虏的生死去向<br />
战争结束后，可清点俘虏，对其进行劝降、斩首或者释放。<br />

Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported!<br>- OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account.<br><strong>- Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!)</strong><br><br><strong>Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase!</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Overview</h2><br>OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type.<br><br>Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease!<br><br>OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.)<br></li><li> Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you.<br></li><li> Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you.<br></li><li> Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world.<br></li><li> Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!)<br></li><li> Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them.<br></li><li> Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click.<br></li><li> Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!)<br></li><li> Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage.<br></li><li> Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch!<br></li><li> Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings!<br></li><li> Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly!<br></li><li> Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too)<br></li><li> Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification.<br></li><li> Macros: Create macro keybinds which can be activated by a click on the wrist to trigger a series of key presses. (Such as changing OBS scenes, muting/un-muting Discord, etc.)<br></li><li> Paste to Game: Clicking the Paste button found under the keyboard will automatically tab in the currently running game and push Ctrl and V. (Can be used to paste links into VRChat video players, paste join codes into codes, etc.) </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Customization</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI.<br></li><li> Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI.<br></li><li> Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications.<br></li><li> Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!)<br></li><li> Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode</h2><br>'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game!<br>(This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!)<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected.<br></li><li> Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input.<br></li><li> Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games.

(All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack)<br></li><li> Bindable voice input key using Google Speech to type out a sentence into a text box you have selected.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Important stuff you should know about</h2><br>We've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works!<br>Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing:<br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you)<br></li><li> OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10)<br></li><li> Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki!<br></li><li> Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard)<br></li><li> Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games!<br></li><li> We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!)<br></li><li> Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix!<br></li><li> Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit. (Most noticeable effects with Flight Simulator 2020)</li></ul> If you have any issues with the application or find other compatibility issues, don't hesitate to contact us! We'll whip up a hotfix ASAP!"

Will you choose to play as Empress Emily Kaldwin or the royal protector, Corvo Attano? Will you make your way through the game unseen, make full use of its brutal combat system, or use a blend of both? How will you combine your character's unique set of powers, weapons and gadgets to eliminate your enemies? The story responds to your choices, leading to intriguing outcomes, as you play through each of the game's hand-crafted missions.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Story</h2>Dishonored 2 is set 15 years after the Lord Regent has been vanquished and the dreaded Rat Plague has passed into history. An otherworldly usurper has seized Empress Emily Kaldwin’s throne, leaving the fate of the Isles hanging in the balance. As Emily or Corvo, travel beyond the legendary streets of Dunwall to Karnaca, the once-dazzling coastal city that holds the keys to restoring Emily to power.

Become a living shadow to silently stalk your targets, link enemies so they share a common fate, or mesmerize your foes and dominate their minds.

The world is a character in its own right, rich with story, architecture and eclectic characters. It is also punctuated by signature mission locations, such as the Dust District, ravaged by dust storms and warring factions, and a madman’s mansion made of shifting walls, deadly traps and clockwork soldiers. <br><br></li><li><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Void Engine</h2>Dishonored 2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in rendering technology, built from id Tech and highly-customized by Arkane Studios.

The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, goblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long as the dwarves do not come into their field of vision. Others gather into quite large groups and try to break into the dwarves’ residence.<br><br><strong>TOWER DEFENSE</strong><br>Especially dangerous are the waves of monsters that appear from time to time from portals. So, do not neglect to build a safe haven with strong walls and numerous trapdoors, cells, firing towers, and secret passageways.<br><br><strong>MAGIC</strong><br>As a divine being, you possess various spells. You can speed up the movement of the dwarves, open small portals, illuminate dark caves to scare away monsters, evoke natural magic in the form of rain or tree growth, hurl fireballs at the monsters’ heads, and find useful resources and hidden rooms underground, thereby helping to speed up resource extraction, exploration of the world, and the population growth of your assistants."

The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enough—there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own.<br />
<br />
Banished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople’s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.<br />

There are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.<br />

Whether working on FaceRig or Animaze, the tech built by us and our former colleagues since 2014 has brought to life and inspired many features used across the VTubing world in many apps today. <br><br>A recent example is Multiplayer Rooms with high-quality full-body motion and filming camera controls, for avatar concerts. This is a feature that many VTubers still think does not yet exist for free anywhere in the world, (not even on apps powered by corporate engines), when it has been available here, on the free tier, starting with March 2023. <br><br>Aside from FaceRig, Animaze remains, as far as we know,  the only indie-engine VTubing app worldwide that propelled some of its users who were using the included stock avatars, to millions of followers. Whether we are talking about Obit or MagLobao on YouTube, or PuffPuff on TikTok, we are proud of opening this path in a truly independent fashion, without the help of any large commercial game engine, and organically with no marketing help from talent management agencies. <br><br>If you are a long-time supporter, thank you!<br>If you are finding us now for the first time, we hope you will join us on this ride.<br><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364390/extras/steam_store_revamp__twitter_.png?t=1740587293"" />"

This means your space stations and forward operating bases are constantly moving as well, forcing you to plan accordingly and adapt to the evolving circumstances – your colonies among the Jovian moons could find that a once-distant alien military outpost or Initiative privateering base has suddenly become a close neighbor.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176470/extras/headline_04.png?t=1741138112"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176470/extras/image_05_loop.gif?t=1741138112"" /><br><br>Terra Invicta explores what might be – how colonies on Mars might function, what plausible engines could power our spaceships, and the nature of how space colonization and warfare might proceed. Players may find themselves establishing a mining base on the asteroid 16 Psyche after noticing it is rich in metals – and then learn that in our world NASA is planning The Psyche Mission for the same reason.<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Exploring and eventually colonizing space will require access to many resources: water for life support and propellant, metals for manufacturing, fissiles for nuclear drives and weapons, and more. At the start, you’ll have no choice but to acquire such resources on Earth and suffer the high cost of using rockets to escape Earth’s gravity, but over time you’ll increasingly choose to instead rely on asteroid mining and other means of securing local supply.<br></li><li>Spaceship design in Terra Invicta draws from the best of scientific speculation and hard science fiction. You can design your own ships, selecting from an array of weapons, drives, and other modules to place on a variety of hulls, ensuring each ship has the right mix of fuel capacity, maneuverability, and other capabilities.<br></li><li>Tactical combat is built around a realistic simulation of Newtonian physics, where momentum and maneuver in 3D space are just as important as the firepower your ships carry. Fire missiles and use point defense cannons to destroy incoming projectiles; build up momentum then swing hard to bring the enemy into your firing arcs; or grapple with the difficult decision to retract radiators and sacrifice heat dissipation to achieve better armor against an incoming enemy barrage.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176470/extras/headline_05.png?t=1741138112"" /><br>Terra Invicta is built with modding support in mind, and much of the game is accessible to modders without a coding background.

Plus there are fun modes like Battle Royale.<br><br><strong>How to Play</strong><br>Players play as either specters or good guys and must determine who the killers are through behavior and speaking in meetings.<br><br>Good guys must constantly watch over the actions of those around them. During meetings, they must clearly describe their whereabouts, who they suspect and why. But don't trust the words of others lightly, and don't make rash conclusions based on conjecture. If you're wrong, your team will be at a disadvantage. Clergy have a broader field of view and must use their skills to lead the good team to victory.<br><br>Specters need to kill all of the good guys without getting caught. They can communicate with teammates with voice messages, use skills to cover each other, and kill good guys or create alibis among chaos.

The stockpile is empty, and without more, reinforcements will not hatch for the ongoing war between the duelling Empires of the Undergrowth.<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Starting from a central room hosting your queen, order your workers to develop and optimise your nest – a vast network of store rooms, nurseries, and hallways. Dig through a hex-based maze of soil and bedrock, seeking food and fending off other underground dwellers.<br></li><li>Push beyond the confines of your nest to see what the world above has to offer – with seeds, nectar, fungus, other insects, and even amphibians on the menu, there's plenty to choose from, but each food source comes with its own strategic tradeoffs and challenges. Will you venture forth and fight off the ladybugs that eat and deplete your source of renewable honeydew drops, or do the surrounding nocturnal creatures present too much of a risk for your fledgling colony? Each decision you make has a ripple effect that can doom your colony if you aren’t quick to react to evolving circumstances.<br></li><li>Manage a multitude of species with different attack patterns, natural weapons, and evolutionary paths to tackle the particular dangers of your current biome.

Few have returned, but they carry valuable sources of food that will help reinforce the front as a new wave of warriors pour forth from the nurseries, eagerly following the scent of pheromones that tell them where to go and what to do en route. They are the last bastion of the colony, born with a singular purpose – hold the line!<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Design and organise multiple nurseries and assign them individual pheromone groups, with each pheromone group taking orders through the placement of pheromone markers, adjustable rules of engagement, and context. Learning to navigate the behaviours of your ants, as well as each species’ strengths and weaknesses, is integral to securing success.<br></li><li>Each pheromone group can be specialised on the fly, told to exclusively collect food, partake in combat, or do both – the right decision can turn the tide of battle. In desperate times, when the colony is starving and new eggs have stopped hatching as a result, will your warrior caste focus on gathering food at the risk of being picked off by aggressive enemies en route? Or will the soldiers divide into escort groups for your remaining workers, ensuring survivability at the cost of overall efficiency elsewhere? Don’t forget to keep at least some workers at the nest to dig, build, and maintain the placement of eggs, to ensure the survival of your ant economy.<br></li><li>Each species of ant presents its own set of strengths and weaknesses on the battlefield. In special game modes where multiple species can be raised in the same colony, your decision to raise and upgrade one or the other will completely change the way you do battle. Trap-jaw ants fight in melee, occasionally leaping back to replenish lost hitpoints. Leafcutter majors fulfil their natural role as protectors by drawing enemy aggression onto themselves to give allied ants an opportunity to flank, regroup, or escape. Wood ants can evolve to fire formic acid as long range artillery or in a more rapid, straight line. Find synergies between the multitude of natural strengths and weaknesses of each species, and prepare to defend against them when warring with rival colonies.<br></li><li>Your enemies are equally varied – apart from other ant colonies, you’ll engage in combat against arachnids, amphibians, crustaceans, and a wide variety of insect species. These powerful and often (comparatively) gigantic creatures present a unique threat to an unprepared colony, and only superior tactics can overcome them. An envelopment manoeuvre can circumvent the adult devil’s coach horse beetle's stunning spray, while tactically isolating and overwhelming hermit crabs one by one will bring their demise faster than they can hunker down to heal.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463530/extras/headline_03.png?t=1740140496"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463530/extras/image_03_loop.gif?t=1740140496"" /><br><br>Victory is certain!

Welcome to the year 3015! It’s a hell of a time to be alive.<br />
<br />
Humanity has colonized thousands of star systems spanning a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. The golden age of cooperation and advancement is now a distant memory, and humanity has once again splintered into disparate factions all vying for supremacy. <br />
<br />
In the midst of these Succession Wars, power hungry Mercenaries like yourself are in a privileged position to capitalize big time. It’s dangerous work but that’s why you’re here, right? If you’ve got an itch to blast, wreck, stomp and go all out ballistic, step inside and become your own weapon of war!  <br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
As the inheritor of a once-prominent Mercenary company, reborn in the flames of its near destruction at the hands of conspiring factions, your quest for glory and revenge will stretch light-years as you chase threads of interstellar intrigue along your journey to becoming an elite MechWarrior and mercenary commander.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE INNER SPHERE<br />
Home to thousands of star systems and an array of stunning biomes, the Inner Sphere is alive with activity, purpose, consequence, and variety. Systems will be captured and reclaimed, major events will unfold, and new technologies will come to light.<br />
<br />
The rigors of war will be seen with each passing week as your relationships with the various factions fluctuate according to the relentless Succession Wars and your choices as the leader of a Mercenary outfit.<br />
<br />
<br />
GAMEPLAY<br />
The battlefields of the future are dominated by BattleMechs, hulking machines of war capable of leveling entire cities. As a BattleMech pilot you’ll rain havoc upon enemy ‘Mechs and targets, including tanks, ground vehicles, aircraft, advanced defenses, and reinforced bases.<br />
<br />
Few things can withstand the power of a ‘Mech for long, and the worlds of the Inner Sphere are veritable playgrounds of destruction awaiting your shielding defense or crushing devastation.<br />
<br />
<br />
BATTLEMECHS<br />
&quot;With over 50 unique ‘Mech chassis and hundreds of sub-variants, all fully-realized with high-fidelity models, damage states, and equipment, no two ‘Mechs are the same!<br />
Whether acquired from scouring the markets of the Inner Sphere for rare and valuable chassis and equipment, or salvaging directly from the wreckage of your annihilated enemies and the spoils of war, the maintenance and operation of your BattleMechs will be vital to your success both as a MechWarrior and a Mercenary outfit commander.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MERC LIFE<br />
Off the battlefield, as the leader of a Mercenary company you will need to manage all the key components of running a unit.<br />
<br />
You’ll need to maintain and acquire ‘Mechs and equipment, hire and field MechWarriors from throughout the Inner Sphere to join you on the battlefield, and manage your relationships with the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, all of whom are vying for your contribution to their staggering war efforts.<br />
<br />
Of course, with each Contract comes negotiation, and with each victory comes consequence.<br />
<br />
<br />
OTHER FEATURES<br />
With the vast scope of the Inner Sphere and its complex system of world generation providing huge variety and replayability, the MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries experience offers no end. Outside the campaign, a fully-featured Instant Action system will allow you to customize and kick off isolated missions at any time, free from campaign restrictions.<br />
<br />

Managing them carefully is critical for success as they are the ones who maintain the complex production chains of your city and are responsible for building structures, harvesting resources, and producing the very goods that keep them satisfied.<br></li><li> Your average peasant will rely on their accrued wealth to lead a fulfilling life. Manage the wages handed out at the end of each day as well as the cost to purchase basic needs like food and beer at the local market to ensure the people stay motivated. High wages and low costs are also an excellent way to encourage migration, but be careful of who you might welcome to your lands.<br></li><li> Peasants hail from different cultures, often at odds with one another, and having them coexist in your small city can be challenging. You can use this friction to your advantage at times, but if the populace has an issue with your noble family’s heritage, you might find hiring additional guards the key to a long life.<br></li><li> Some peasants are devout adherents to the Church of Saint Sophia, and will care most for a noble’s piety, while loyalist peasants simply need enough money to buy food and beer to remain happy. Other factions and sub-factions have different priorities – as you expand and grow stronger, expect these groups to form shifting alliances where they find common ground. Even when they’re formally on your side, though, their actions and methods might not be to your advantage, and you will never escape the consequences of their separate agendas.<br></li><li> When tensions flair, don’t hesitate to establish a nightly patrol, or to give a few unruly members the literal ax.
